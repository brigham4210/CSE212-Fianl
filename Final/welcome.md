#Python Fundamental Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Python Fundamental Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [queue](queue/queue.md)
- [set](set/set.md)
- [tree](tree/tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
